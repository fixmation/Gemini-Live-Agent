UI Navigator ☸️

Focus: Visual UI Understanding & Interaction

Build an agent that becomes the user's hands on screen. The agent observes the browser or device display, interprets visual elements with or without relying on APIs or DOM access, and performs actions based on user intent. Examples include a universal web navigator, a cross-application workflow automator, or a visual QA testing agent.

Mandatory Tech: Must use Gemini multimodal to interpret screenshots/screen recordings and output executable actions. The agents are hosted on Google Cloud.
